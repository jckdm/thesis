      <p><span id="isaias">Today</span> is the tenth day since tropical storm Isaias passed over the northeast and much of East Rock is still without power.
         Most noticeable are the blocked sidewalks and streets, which make the neighborhood into somewhat of a maze.
         After a week of climbing over branches on my daily walks, I don't feel so crazy thinking to venture into the park—it's not like the winds could've washed away the familiar trails.
         I enter the park and follow the trail which parallels the road until turning sharply and beginning to ascend.
         Some thirty yards ahead, a fallen tree blocks the trail.
         Around it, a narrow path winds briefly into the bushes and emerges on the other side.
         The path is not deep, nor well-defined, but it has a quiet conviction.
         Its fate will be determined by how long it takes the city to clear the trail.
         For now, it is a refreshing detour.
      </p>
      <p>I jog ahead and leap over another tree as if I'm avoiding a puddle which hugs a curb.
         Within moments I burst out of the greenery and onto the road.
         Pausing briefly, I realize that I can't see the trail from which I came.
         Spinning in slow circles it dawns on me that I'm lost.
         I cross the road and dive boldly into the trees, beginning to climb with my hands and feet.
         Loosened by the heavy rains, everything I grab feels impermanent: rocks tumble down the sloping hill, tree roots snap in my hands.
         <span class="q">What differentiates the way trails resist interference by humans and by nature?</span>
        </p>
         <p>I have no particular fear of heights, but I don't dare to look behind myself.
         Surely beyond the next ridge I'll burst out onto another road and startle a family on their evening stroll.
         Lost in thought, I'm blinded by sunlight as it breaks through the foliage.
         I rush forwards and scramble over the edge, squirming in the sandy gravel like an unlucky fish washed ashore.
      </p>
      <p><span id="atop">I</span> am atop East Rock—that much I am sure of—and I can see nothing but sky.
        I'm awakened by the sight of a man reclining on a flat rock, bathing in golden sunlight.
        He tips his beer towards me and welcomes me to happy hour.
        I am doubtful that I could ever again retrace this path, but for now I am focused on the journey.

      <p> Cross Campus no longer feels like it once did, back when it was the nexus of our carefree universe, back when we brushed shoulders and crossed paths without care.
        Now that I no longer live downtown, I have a new perspective on the city.
        Now that I no longer live on Yale's campus, everything takes just a few minutes more.
      </p>
      <p><span id="tweed">See,</span> all my friends tell me that it's worth it to drive up to Hartford to fly out of Bradley.
        They say it's worth it—even if it takes just a few minutes more.
        Now that I live in East Rock, I can appreciate that feeling.
        The pace of life in the city is unchanged, but the paths I take as I traverse its landscape feel brand new.
        <span class="q">How can shifts in perception change our experience with familiar environments?</span>

      <p>Spending the last few weeks writing my data tracking tools, and then creating visualizations of that data, has reminded me of the distance between my ideas and their eventual executions.
        This isn't a complaint about delayed gratification, but rather a reminder that everything is a series of decisions, which is especially true in the digital space.
      </p>
      <p>If I were to wander through my neighborhood, I'd be restricted by the grid of blocks and the rows of houses, by the flow of traffic and the need to maintain six feet of distance.
        I suppose that I could get away with cutting through a backyard or two, that I may slip by unnoticed if I were to move as the crow flies and climb over fences and to open any unlocked door.
      </p>
      <p><span id="boundaries">That</span> is to say: in the physical space, there are nothing but boundaries in the way of movement, and I'm not sure if these "blockers" have digitial equivalents.
        Firewalls, access controls, system administrators, need-to-know hierarchies, 401 and 403 status codes.
        Maybe.
        <span class="q">But in my personal, digital environment, do I face any of these blockers?</span> Unless I were to self-impose restrictions, I'd be free to roam.
        Freedom doesn't mean that movement is no longer defined as a series of decisions as I framed it in physical space, but it's freedom from the watchful eyes of...whomever.
        Unless, of course, I were aware that my data is being recorded and my movements tracked.
        They aren't at this moment, though, so I suppose I'm free to roam until the sun comes up.

      <p>I often joke that I walk into more spiderwebs than the average person—but I know that I can only blame myself for this misfortune.
        Recently I noticed that a daddy long-legs spider has been living behind my toilet and I’ve begun to worry that I am destroying its home when I vacuum, or find myself caught in a web.
        Somehow, it is rare that I find my body engulfed in something bigger than itself—not in the way that laying beneath a large blanket can feel like being in a new world, but in the way that walking into a spiderweb is a full-body experience.
        First, it is my arms which shoot up, then my hands begin swatting and grabbing away pieces of web before I dance myself free.
      </p>
      <p><span id="visibility">Tonight,</span> the spider has left its home and is sleeping in the middle of my bathroom floor.
        A bold move, but I’m feeling compassionate.
        I wish I could track its movement, but it often disappears into crevices, or into the radiator, or...well, I don’t know where—that’s what it makes it so mysterious: its ability to traverse between planes of visibility, to exist, to thrive, to sustain itself while remaining out of sight.
        I’m reminded of the strangely well-known tidbit about throwing dogs off your trail by passing through a body of water.
        <span class="q">I suppose water, much like cracks in the wall, are agents of spatial discovery?</span>—the spider goes in, the spider comes out.
      </p>
      <p>The next morning is cloudy and I watch a small plane fly overhead.
        I longingly wait for it to pierce a cloud and disappear into a new dimension, but it moves along steadily as it traces the coastline towards its destination in Stratford.
        Goodbye, blue sky.
      </p>

      <p>I am sitting on a dusty step in the hallway of a friend’s apartment building waiting for her to return home.
        I open my Notes app and search the word “hallway”; three results appear.
        The first is unsorted notes for a short piece I wrote about two sisters who shared a house next-door to my grandfather.
        After their deaths, my mother took home an old bench of theirs which is now in our hallway.
        The second note is a ranked list of every single room in Ezra Stiles College where I considered living junior year.
        <span id="hallway">Room</span> A41, I observe, is at the end of the hallway.
        The third note is an unsent letter addressed to the man with whom I shared an apartment two summers ago.
        After he had left for Tibet, I began collecting all of the things I wanted to tell him.
        Towards the end of the summer I ecstatically typed that I came to believe our landlord to be a recreational marijuana user.
        This conclusion arose during a visit to her house to do laundry after my washing machine had broken.
      </p>
      <p>I hear voices below me in the stairwell and I peer through the railing.
        All three of these hallways sound more interesting than this one, which needs to be hosed down and repainted.
        Since tightly-packed waiting rooms have gone out of fashion during Covid, I’ve spent quite a bit of time waiting in hallways.
        I haven't become any more fond of them, or how light and air seem to never find their way from one end to the other, always getting lost somewhere inbetween.
      </p>
      <p>I want to search another word in my Notes app, but something holds me back: I don't like to think of my writing as data, something which can be queried.
        That being said, I don't like that <i>any</i> of my digital activity can be distanced from its original form and turned into data.
        This line of questioning is new for me: <span class="q">do I like my data? Do I like what it does, how it looks and feels?</span>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t yet have answers to those questions, and I’m not sure where I'll find them, either.
        For now, that's OK.
        I skip down the steps to the first floor and out into the cold air.
      </p>

      <p><span id="monitor">I’m</span> still waiting for the day that I meet someone who actually served as a Hall Monitor, someone who proves to me that such a position exists.
        Now that I’ve used my data tracking tools to collect data from two users, I feel like a digital Hall Monitor, myself.
        Like Clippy, but nosier and less helpful.
        <span class="q">Isn’t that the idea behind most “smart home” products?</span>—nosy and unhelpful but kind of cute!
        I get it; some days when I grab a doorknob I wish it would snap at me for being rough with it.
        Maybe such an invention could be useful during Covid: surfaces which scream when touched with germy hands.
        Light-switches which grunt, remote controls which yell, towels which groan when you rub those filthy hands all over them.
        These inventions sound like they escaped from Jeff Bezos’ wet dream.
      </p>
      <p>As of now, I don't think that developing my data tracking tools has changed how I use my computer.
        But comparing my data to that of other users, I do feel rather ecclectic: within 7 hours I used 17 different applications.
        <span class="q">Could I name even half of the applications I use on a given day?</span>
        Not off the top of my head—but I know that I rely uniquely on each.
        These 17 applications are like delinquint students caught sneaking down a hallway and sent to the Principal's office—also known as my database.
      </p>
      <p>So here I am, about to enter the 8th week of this project and I have both made, and become, a digital Hall Monitor.
        You are what you code.
      </p>
      <div class="space"></div>
      <text>10.21.20 00:42</text>
      <p>I’ve started asking more people for consent to track their data and I’m excited to have gotten my first rejection.
        At this milestone, I’ll take a moment to solidify some of the central questions I’ve been asking myself.
      </p>
      <p>Imagine walking after a heavy rain and leaving wet footprints on the sidewalk.
        You don’t think much of this; you don’t worry about being tracked.
        Then you realize that there’s someone trailing behind taking photographs of your footprints as they evaporate.
        Weird, but footprints aren’t data, they’re just the side effect of walking somewhere—so, no big deal.
        But the place you’re headed to, and the place you came from—that information is personal, right?
      </p>
      <p><span id="footprints">The</span> difference is abstraction: a couple of footprints on a sidewalk mean nothing without context, but when fully collected and ordered, they form a path.
        What if you’re lost, and the photographer could make footprints appear ahead of you, illuminating the next step?
        That sounds useful, so maybe you’d consent to the photographing.
        And part of informed consent is knowing your end of the bargain: you’ll let Google Maps record your path in return for the promise of efficient directions.
        <span class="q">But would you consent to data collection without a tangible, measurable benefit?</span>
        Would you let the stranger continue photographing your footprints without reason?
      </p>
      <p> This is where I get stuck because I’m struggling to define “functional” data.
        Mouse coordinates, in the abstract, serve no personal function.
        Even spread across a timeline, they still mean nothing.
        <span class="q">But the act of collection, the creation and existence of this data, whom does that make responsible for its preservation, transportation, modification, or eventual destruction?</span>
        I could hire someone else to manage my data, but that would give it undue attention—and I still haven’t pinned down a tangible benefit.
      </p>
      <p>I’m suddenly reminded of what it felt like to be home-bound during the initial wave of Covid across the northeast.
        I would venture outside only for essential activities, and it felt as if I had no way of knowing if businesses were open.
        Blind to the world, I resorted to asking strangers on the internet if they lived near some of my favorite restaurants.
        Eventually I found a man who lives above one, and he confirmed that they had begun offering take-out.
        To me, this man was nothing but a datapoint in a sea of profiles.
        His location was relevant insofar as it was a means to the completion of a task, and I sought out his knowledge because I found it personally advantageous—I found it functional.
        <span class="q">When all is reduced to data, does it not become dangerously easy to discard what is not functional, like a footprint, or a profile, or maybe even someone’s humanity?</span>
      </p>
      <div class="space"></div>

      <p>Watching ballot counting feels like creating a path across the states which comprise our country, like making a rubbing of our electoral topography.
        I don't know if, in the end, we will remember which votes were mailed, or which were cast early—or if the President's rallying cry of "legal votes" will haunt us in the way that "alternative facts" has.
      </p>
      <p><span id="ballot">In</span> some ways, the counting of ballots reminds me of a recipe: my roommate believes that recipes are only suggestions of paths we can follow or choose to diverge from.
        When the tablecloth has been laid and a meal has been served, who could retrace a path back to a pot of boiling water, and who would think to do so?
      </p>
      <p>It isn't known when we'll have final tallies in Nevada, or in Arizona, or in Pennsylvania or Georgia or North Carolina.
        I certainly don't blame the news outlets who are hesitant to call these states: <span class="q">once a map is drawn, can it ever really be taken apart?</span>
        Maybe maps, much like recipes, cannot be put into reverse.
      </p>
      <p>When looking at electoral maps from 2016 and 2012, I don't remember which states were called before others.
        I don't remember how it felt to watch map being drawn.
        But I still feel a glaring intensity when I look at the 2016 map in particular, smothered in misplaced red.
        I wish I could peel back the colored layer and reveal the unchanging outlines of each state—then peel back another to remove the counties, and then another and another until nothing is left but land and water like the universe intended.
      </p>

      <p>Yesterday I missed class because my Wi-Fi couldn’t hold a steady signal.
        This morning the Trump campaign held a press conference in the parking lot of a landscaping business.
        This afternoon a rotting pumpkin was left on the sidewalk across from my house.
        This evening I ordered a pair of vintage hoop earrings from a woman who lives on the southern edge of Lake Tahoe.
        Today I was sent videos of street corners flooded with people whose bodies are full of joy—I recognized some of those bodies and wish that mine could have been among theirs.
      </p>
      <p><span id="wifi">Today</span> is the first day that I’ve worked outside of my apartment—but I only made it as far as the front porch.
        After months of being confined to the home, it feels like multitasking to breathe fresh air while also watching a lecture about multiple regression.
        These days, going outside is an act which requires such specific preparation, such intention, that it has become an event.
        Two summers ago, when I first lived in East Rock, I would spend entire evenings reading on my porch despite its thin layer of grime which blew over from the nearby highway.
        These days it’s either my desk, my bed, or the kitchen table.
      </p>
      <p>But this morning I found a hotspot and sat on my porch to catch up on the week’s lectures.
        Living on the busiest corner in the neighborhood has certainly posed challenges and brought joys, and today has been full of both.
        <span class="q">In the age of social distancing, my computer is simultaneously my key to the world, and my greatest obstacle to uninhibited movement.
        Wi-Fi has become both a limiting factor and a multiplier</span>; and me, I’m still stringing together disparate moments hoping they'll feel like days.
