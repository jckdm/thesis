      <p id="isaias">Today is the tenth day since tropical storm Isaias passed over the northeast and much of East Rock is still without power.
         Most noticeable are the blocked sidewalks and streets, which make the neighborhood into somewhat of a maze.
         After a week of climbing over branches on my daily walks, I don't feel so crazy thinking to venture into the park—it's not like the winds could've washed away the familiar trails.
         <span class="q">(What is it about these trails that makes me believe they are reliable, durable, and longevous?)</span>
         I enter the park and follow the trail which parallels the road until turning sharply and beginning to ascend.
         I already see a tree some thirty yards up which blocks the trail.
         Around it, a narrow path winds briefly into the bushes and emerges on the other side.
         The path is not deep, nor well-defined, but it has a quiet conviction.
         It was forged through feet, and its fate will be determined by how long it takes the city to clear the trail.
      </p>
      <p>The path is a refreshing detour from the otherwise tried-and-true, city-approved trail, which I suddenly feel ready to abandon.
         Another tree blocks the trail and I dash over it like a puddle which hugs a curb.
         I jog ahead and within moments I burst out of the greenery and onto the road.
         I have never seen this road.
         I turn around and cannot see the trail from which I came, but I couldn't be lost—I'm <i>on</i> the road.
         Filled with determination, I dive forwards into the trees and begin to climb with my hands and feet.
         Loosened by the heavy rains, everything I grab feels impermanent.
         Rocks tumble down the sloping hill, tree roots snap off in my hands as I scramble onwards and upwards.
         <span class="q">(What differentiates the ways in which trails can resist interference by humans and by nature?)</span>
         I have no particular fear of heights, but I don't dare to look behind myself.
         Surely beyond the next ridge I'll burst out onto the road and startle a family on their evening stroll.
         Lost in thought, sunlight breaks through the foliage and blinds me as I stand upright.
         I rush forwards and scramble over the edge, squirming in the sandy gravel like an unlucky fish washed ashore.
      </p>
      <p id="atop">I am atop East Rock, but I am not looking up at the familiar monument; instead, I am met by nothing but sky.
         I am doubtful that I would ever again be able to retrace this path, but for now I am only focused on the journey—and the journey is only just beginning.
         <span class="q">[My experience with these paths is driven by a feeling of confidence, which is inspired by our collective memory of the park.]</span>

      <p id="tweed"> Cross Campus no longer feels like it once did, back when it was the nexus of our carefree universe, back when we brushed shoulders and crossed paths without care.
        Now that I no longer live downtown, I have a new perspective on the city.
        Now that I no longer live on Yale's campus, everything takes just a few minutes more.
      </p>
      <p> See, all my friends tell me that it's worth it to drive up to Hartford to fly out of Bradley.
          They say it's worth it—even if it takes just a few minutes more.
          Now that I live in East Rock, I can appreciate that feeling.
          The pace of life in the city is unchanged, but the paths I take as I traverse its landscape feel brand new.
          <span class="q">How can shifts in social conditions change our perception of, and experience with, familiar built environments?</span>
