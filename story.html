      <p id="isaias">Today is the tenth day since tropical storm Isaias passed over the northeast and much of East Rock is still without power.
         Most noticeable are the blocked sidewalks and streets, which make the neighborhood into somewhat of a maze.
         After a week of climbing over branches on my daily walks, I don't feel so crazy thinking to venture into the park—it's not like the winds could've washed away the familiar trails.
         <span class="q">(What is it about these trails that makes me believe they are reliable, durable, and longevous?)</span>
         I enter the park and follow the trail which parallels the road until turning sharply and beginning to ascend.
         I already see a tree some thirty yards up which blocks the trail.
         Around it, a narrow path winds briefly into the bushes and emerges on the other side.
         The path is not deep, nor well-defined, but it has a quiet conviction.
         It was forged through feet, and its fate will be determined by how long it takes the city to clear the trail.
      </p>
      <p>The path is a refreshing detour from the otherwise tried-and-true, city-approved trail, which I suddenly feel ready to abandon.
         Another tree blocks the trail and I dash over it like a puddle which hugs a curb.
         I jog ahead and within moments I burst out of the greenery and onto the road.
         I have never seen this road.
         I turn around and cannot see the trail from which I came, but I couldn't be lost—I'm <i>on</i> the road.
         Filled with determination, I dive forwards into the trees and begin to climb with my hands and feet.
         Loosened by the heavy rains, everything I grab feels impermanent.
         Rocks tumble down the sloping hill, tree roots snap off in my hands as I scramble onwards and upwards.
         <span class="q">(What differentiates the ways in which trails can resist interference by humans and by nature?)</span>
         I have no particular fear of heights, but I don't dare to look behind myself.
         Surely beyond the next ridge I'll burst out onto the road and startle a family on their evening stroll.
         Lost in thought, sunlight breaks through the foliage and blinds me as I stand upright.
         I rush forwards and scramble over the edge, squirming in the sandy gravel like an unlucky fish washed ashore.
      </p>
      <p id="atop">I am atop East Rock, but I am not looking up at the familiar monument; instead, I am met by nothing but sky.
         I am doubtful that I would ever again be able to retrace this path, but for now I am only focused on the journey—and the journey is only just beginning.
         <span class="q">[My experience with these paths is driven by a feeling of confidence, which is inspired by our collective memory of the park.]</span>

      <p> Cross Campus no longer feels like it once did, back when it was the nexus of our carefree universe, back when we brushed shoulders and crossed paths without care.
        Now that I no longer live downtown, I have a new perspective on the city.
        Now that I no longer live on Yale's campus, everything takes just a few minutes more.
      </p>
      <p id="tweed"> See, all my friends tell me that it's worth it to drive up to Hartford to fly out of Bradley.
          They say it's worth it—even if it takes just a few minutes more.
          Now that I live in East Rock, I can appreciate that feeling.
          The pace of life in the city is unchanged, but the paths I take as I traverse its landscape feel brand new.
          <span class="q">(How can shifts in social conditions change our perception of, and experience with, familiar built environments?)</span>

      <p> Spending the last few weeks coding has reminded me of the distance between my ideas and their eventual executions.
        This isn't a complaint about delayed gratification, but rather a reminder that everything is a series of decisions, which is especially true in the digital space.
      </p>
      <p id="boundaries">If I were to wander through my neighborhood, I'd be restricted by the grid of blocks and the rows of houses, by the flow of traffic and by the need to maintain six feet of distance.
        I suppose that I could get away with cutting through a backyard or two, that I may slip by unnoticed if I were to move as the crow flies and climb over fences and to open any unlocked door.
      </p>
      <p>That is to say that in the physical space, there are nothing but boundaries in the way of my movement, and I'm not sure if these blockers have digitial equivalents.
        Firewalls, access controls, system administrators, need-to-know hierarchies, 401 and 403 status codes.
        Maybe.
        <span class="q">But in my personal, digital environment, do I face any of these blockers?</span> Unless I were to self-impose restrictions, I'd be free to roam.
        Freedom doesn't mean that movement is no longer defined as a series of decisions as I framed it in physical space, but it's freedom from the watchful eyes of...whomever.
        Unless, of course, I were aware that my data is being recorded and my movements tracked.
        They aren't at this moment, though, so I suppose I'm free to roam until the sun comes up.

      <p>I often joke that I walk into more spiderwebs than the average person—but I know that I can only blame myself for this misfortune.
        Recently I noticed that a daddy long-legs spider has been living behind my toilet and I’ve begun to worry that I am destroying its home when I vacuum, or find myself caught in a web.
        Somehow, it is rare that I find my body engulfed in something bigger than itself—not in the way that laying beneath a large blanket can feel like being in a new world, but in the way that walking into a spiderweb is a full-body experience.
        First, it is my arms which shoot up, then my hands begin swatting and grabbing away pieces of web before I dance myself free.
      </p>
      <p id="visibility">Tonight, the spider has left its home and is sleeping in the middle of my bathroom floor.
        A bold move, but I’m feeling compassionate.
        I wish I could track its movement, but it often disappears into crevices, or into the radiator, or...well, I don’t know where—that’s what it makes it so mysterious: its ability to traverse between planes of visibility, to exist, to thrive, to sustain itself while remaining out of sight.
        I’m reminded of the strangely well-known tidbit about throwing dogs off of your trail by passing through a body of water.
        <span class="q">I suppose water, much like cracks in the wall, are agents of spatial discovery?</span>—the spider goes in, the spider comes out.
      </p>
      <p>The next morning is cloudy and I watch a small plane fly overhead.
        I longingly wait for it to pierce a cloud and disappear into a new dimension, but it moves along steadily as it traces the coastline towards its destination in Stratford.
        Goodbye, blue sky.

      <p id="hallway">I am sitting on a dusty step in the hallway of a friend’s apartment building waiting for her to return home.
        I open my Notes app and search the word “hallway”; three results appear.
        The first is unsorted notes for a short piece I wrote about two sisters who shared a house next-door to my grandfather.
        After their deaths, my mother took home an old bench of theirs which is now in our hallway.
        The second note is a ranked list of every single room in Ezra Stiles College where I considered living junior year.
        Room A41, I observe, is at the end of the hallway.
        The third and final note is an unsent letter addressed to the man with whom I shared an apartment two summers ago.
        I wrote the letter after he had left for Tibet, and in it I collected all of the things which I wanted to tell him.
        Towards the end of the summer I ecstatically typed that I came to believe our landlord to be a recreational marijuana user.
        This conclusion arose during a visit to her house to do laundry after my washing machine had broken.
      </p>
      <p>I hear voices in the stairwell below me and I peer through the railing.
        All three of these hallways sound more interesting than the one I’m in now, which needs to be hosed down and repainted.
        Since tightly-packed waiting rooms have gone out of fashion during COVID, I’ve spent quite a bit of time waiting in hallways.
        I can't say that I've become any more fond of them, or the way that light and air seem to never find their way from one end to the other, always getting lost somewhere inbetween.
      </p>
      <p>I want to search another word in my Notes app, but something holds me back: I don't like to think of my writing as data, something which can be queried.
        That being said, I don't like that <i>any</i> of my digital activity can be distanced from its original form and turned into data.
        This line of questioning is new for me: <span class="q">Do I like my data? Do I like what it does, how it looks and feels?</span>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t yet have answers to those questions, and I’m not sure where I'll find them, either.
        For now, that's OK.
        I skip down the steps to the first floor and out into the cold air.
