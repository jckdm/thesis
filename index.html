      <p id="isaias">Today is the tenth day since tropical storm Isaias passed over the northeast and much of East Rock is still without power.
         Most noticeable are the blocked sidewalks and streets, which make the neighborhood into somewhat of a maze.
         After a week of climbing over branches on my daily walks, I don't feel so crazy thinking to venture into the park—it's not like the winds could've washed away the familiar trails.
         <span class="q">(Is it time or experience which fuels this feeling of certainty?)</span>
         I enter the park and follow the trail which parallels the road until turning sharply and beginning to ascend.
         From just the first step, I already see a tree some thirty yards up which blocks the trail.
         Around it, a narrow path winds briefly into the bushes and emerges on the other side.
         The path is not deep, nor well-defined, but it has a quiet conviction.
         It was forged through feet, and its fate will be determined by how long it takes the city to clear the trail.
      </p>
      <p>The path is a refreshing detour from the otherwise straight, tried-and-true, city-approved trail, which I suddenly feel ready to abandon.
         Another tree blocks the trail and I dash over it like a puddle which hugs a curb.
         I jog ahead and within a moment I burst out of the greenery and onto the road.
         I have never seen this road.
         I turn around and cannot see the trail from which I came, but I couldn't be lost—I'm <i>on</i> the road.
         Filled with determination, I dive forwards into the trees and begin to climb with both my hands and feet.
         Loosened by the heavy rains, everything I grab feels impermanent.
         Rocks tumble down the sloping hill, tree roots snap off in my hands as I scramble onwards and upwards.
         <span class="q">(To what extent can trails resist human interference?)</span>
         I have no particular fear of heights, but I don't dare to look behind myself.
         Surely beyond the next tree I'll burst out onto a road and startle a family enjoying their evening stroll.
         Lost in thought, sunlight finally breaks through the foliage and blinds me as I stand upright, pressing my back against a tree.
         I rush forwards and scramble over the edge, squirming in the sandy gravel like an unlucky fish washed ashore.
      </p>
      <p id="atop">I am atop East Rock, but I am not looking up at the familiar monument; instead, I am met by nothing but sky.
         I am doubtful that I would ever again be able to retrace this path, but for now I am only focused on the journey—and the journey is only just beginning.
         <span class="q">[My experience with these paths is shaped by a feeling of confidence, which is inspired by collective memory.]</span>
