# Digital Distancing

In the post-[GDPR](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/what-is-gdpr-uk-eu-legislation-compliance-summary-fines-2018) world, it seems that every online interaction comes packaged with constant reminders of data tracking. For the first time in the digital age, our data can be experienced with the most rudimentary digital verbs: VIEW your data, DOWNLOAD your data, DELETE your data. Previously taken in secret, data now comes hand in hand with consent; but have we become any more in control of our digital footprint? Is it our awareness, our potential for intervention, or is it our passive consent which gives us this shaky semblance of control?

I propose two tools, both of which seek to redefine our relationship with data through novel visual interpretations.

## The Tracker

*I propose a tool which records data by following, among other things, a user’s mouse, keystrokes, and current application.* Using this data, the tool will create visual representations of a user’s computer usage, producing images which illuminate paths, hotspots, and textures. Rather than tracking tasks and analyzing trends for the purpose of creating a sellable product, the tool tracks gesture, space, and time. The recorded data serves no 'functional' purpose and exists like radio static in the background of our digital environments. By centering the minutia, and by creating mass amounts of it, the tool seeks to reverse the conversation, serving as a platform for reflection, commentary, and retort towards our relationship with this intensely personal, yet otherwise unnoticed data. These untraceable maps between windows, images, and applications reduce all interactions to data, and beg the question of what it means for data to have a function.

## The Tracer

*I propose a tool which extracts Exif data from digital images, specifically their coordinates and timestamps.* Using this data, the tool will create visual representations of a user's paths through physical space, producing images which illustrate alternative geometries. Rather than mapping this data to specific locations for the purpose of surveillance and tracking, the tool considers coordinates abstractly. Devoid of context, the abstracted data serves no 'functional' purpose yet is stored in the forefront of our physical memory. By interpreting our physical experiences in digital contexts, the tool seeks to defamiliarize us from our images, serving as a method of reinterpretation and reorganization of the data embedded in our visual artifacts. These untraceable maps between points of interest reduce all physical locations to data, and beg the question of what it means for data to have a function.

### Which begs the big question,

What does this data tell us? Can we guess as to a user's age, their technological comfort, or their amount of focus? Can we guess as to the images' locations, their subject, or the time between their creation? How are these assumptions informed by our technological biases? Who defines digital behavior, and what differentiates it from our physical behavior? As we socially distance and learn to be hyper-aware of how we move through public, physical spaces, how are we (re-)learning to move through our private, digital spaces?
